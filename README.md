# Fake-news-Detection-of-Live-media
Fake news is defined as a made-up story with an intention to deceive or to mislead. In this paper we present the solution to the task of fake news detection by using Deep Learning architectures after converting the live media stream audio into text.

The purpose of our project is to create a model which can detect fake news by identifying the most optimal parameter that can give the greatest accuracy. We also studied how different hyper-parameters affect the model performance and summarized the details for future work.
